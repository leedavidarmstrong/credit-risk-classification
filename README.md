Loan Risk Classification Model
This GitHub repository contains code and instructions for building a logistic regression model to assess loan risk using historical lending data. In the provided Jupyter notebook, we split the dataset into training and testing sets, create and evaluate the model's performance, and generate a credit risk analysis report. We follow coding conventions, provide well-commented code, and offer a report template for summarizing results. Use this repository as a guide for creditworthiness assessment in peer-to-peer lending services.
